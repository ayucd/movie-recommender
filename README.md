# Movie Recommendation System
Content-based Movie Recommendation System deployed on Heroku.

## Abstract

Content-based recommendation is an important approach in recommender systems. The basic idea is to recommend items that are similar with what user liked before. The core mission of content-based recommender system is to calculate the similarity between items. There are a lot of methods to model item and the most famous one is Vector Space Model. Using keywords to model item is an important step for many recommender systems. But extracting keywords of an item is also a difficult problem, because it is very hard to extract text keywords from a video. For solving this kind of problem, there are two main ways. One is letting experts tag the items and another one is letting users tag them.
